# Lamborghini Terzo Car Animation

## Project Description
This project showcases a highly detailed 3D animation of the Lamborghini Terzo, created using Blender, a powerful 3D modeling and animation software. It focuses on advanced techniques such as modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering to produce a realistic animation that highlights the car's intricate design and fluid motion. Special emphasis is placed on the precision of motion, lighting effects, and realistic rendering to capture the car's behavior in a lifelike manner.

## Features
- **Detailed 3D Model**: Accurate modeling of the Lamborghini Terzo, including all its curves, design elements, and mechanical features.
- **Realistic Texturing**: High-quality textures applied to the car's body, interior, and surrounding environment.
- **Advanced Lighting Effects**: Realistic lighting setups to mimic natural and artificial light sources, including reflections and shadows.
- **Precise Motion**: Fluid and lifelike motion of the car, with special attention to the physics of the wheels, suspension, and aerodynamics.
- **High-Quality Rendering**: The animation is rendered using Blender's advanced rendering engine to produce a high-fidelity, photorealistic result.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `.blend` file in Blender (compatible with Blender 3.x).
3. Ensure you have the necessary Blender add-ons installed, if any.
4. Hit `F12` to render the animation or use the animation timeline to preview it.

## Usage
- **Customization**: You can modify the car model or animations by navigating to the `Assets` folder within the Blender project.
- **Lighting Adjustment**: To change the lighting effects, go to the `Lighting` settings in the project file and tweak the sources for different visual styles.
- **Motion Tuning**: Adjust the car’s movement and wheel rotation by editing the keyframes in the timeline.

## Screenshots
*Include any renderings or video clips showcasing your project.*
